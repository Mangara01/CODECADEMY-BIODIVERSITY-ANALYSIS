# Biodiversity Analysis in National Park

## Objective

This project aims to interpret data provided by the National Parks Service regarding species in various national parks. It involves data analysis, cleaning, visualization, and identifying patterns or themes related to the conservation statuses of these species.

## Analysis

* Relationship between Conservation Status and Category.
* Relationship between Park Name and Category.
* Relationship between Park Name and Conservation Status.

## Conclusion

* The Conservation Status "Species of Concern" has the largest number of animals compared to other Conservation Statuses. This suggests that there are more species in the park that are of concern for their conservation.
* The "Species of Concern" category is dominated by birds, indicating that a significant portion of the animals in this status are avian species facing conservation challenges.
* The Conservation Status "Endangered" is dominated by mammals, which implies that a substantial number of endangered animals in the park belong to this group.
* "In Recovery" status is primarily composed of mammals and birds, indicating that these two groups have a higher representation among the species that are on the path to recovery.
* "Threatened" species are primarily fish, suggesting that the animals in the "Threatened" category are predominantly fish species.
* There is no significant difference in the number of animals throughout the park. This means that, on the whole, the park appears to maintain a relatively balanced distribution of animals across the various Conservation Statuses.
* There is no statistically significant association between Park Name and Conservation Status. This indicates that the distribution of species across different Conservation Statuses is consistent across all parks, and there is no particular park where a specific Conservation Status is significantly more prevalent.

In summary, the information provided highlights the diversity of Conservation Statuses and their dominant groups of animals in the park, with no significant variation in animal numbers among parks or in their association with specific Conservation Statuses.
